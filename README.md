# edtr
*my personal text and markdown editor. for creative writing, not for code. one html file.*

## qna

### "what is it?"
- edtr is a .txt and .md editor. i wrote it because i was dissatisfied with the mainstream editors.
- it's meant to feel a bit like a typewriter. 

### "should i stop using my current .txt and/or .md editor to use this one?"
- nope. this is a very personal project to allow me to use exactly the setup i've wanted for many years.
  - so, only if your tastes are very much like mine.
- it's very idiosyncratic. so very unlikly. :)
